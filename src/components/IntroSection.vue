        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a part time software engineer and full time cat person who likes problem solving and
            puzzles.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't have any fancy repositories for you to see (I'm sure you can understand as a
            software developer, most of our client works are proprietary), though you can still head
            over to my <a href="https://github.com/fattynomnom">Github</a> to view my personal
            projects I'm working on when I have the time!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a huge advocate for Typescript, object-oriented programming and clean coding
            practices (DRY, SOLID). I know writing it is a pain, but reading clean code is
            <i>*chefs kiss*</i>. Do I sit back sometimes and admire clean code structures? Yes, yes
            I do.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies are gardening, reading mangas, watching movies and starting 1001 coding
            projects that I don't finish.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm trying to hold myself accountable by creating this site to document my learning
            process. Hopefully I'll be able to learn and update this space as much as possible (when
            life, work and cats doesn't get in the way).
        </p>
        <p>
            Just in case you're curious, this site was made with VueJs and TailwindCss (both of
            which I <i>think</i> I'm a master at).
